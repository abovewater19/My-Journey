      <p>Currently, I'm working through building my skills and becoming a competent developer of some sorts. This is with the goal that I can successfully understake a Masters in Computer Science and understand what is happening. Here you'll find a collection of the resources that I've used to build my skills and my portfolio. I'm hosting this page on github pages and it is a way of showing how I'm progressing along the jounrey.</p>

              <p>October is here and it's the time I'm finally getting serious about this stuff. I've been thinking about it for a long time and day dreaming about what I could be doing. Is programming right me? Maybe. We'll see. In the mean time, I'm throwing everything I have at it. Because I want to be able to look back on it all and say, "Well, hot damn. Look at what I have been able to accomplish." This page is a way of keeping a timeline and a journal so that i can show case what I've been able to accomplish by putting my mind to it. </p>
              <p>What I'm finding at the moment is that I'm spending a lot of time trying to understand the things that I don't get. One of those things in the general developer practices. That is, using git and creating documentation for the website. I'm still not sure that whether I need to be creatinging documentation so much for a website that I'm just writing myself but more so for an application that I'm creating. Building this website, I'm actively trying to build the content out as much as I can so that I'm providing a resource to others in a similar boat. </p>
